## Features (Expanded)

The university website includes several key features:

### User Scenarios
- **As a Student**: I can log in, view my enrolled courses, check for announcements, and manage my profile.
- **As a Faculty Member**: I can log in to view my courses, manage course content, and communicate with students through announcements.

## Routing
The routing structure is defined in `app.routes.ts`. Key routes include:
- `/login`: Login page for users.
- `/courses`: List of available courses.
- `/announcements`: Page for university announcements.

## Components
- **HeaderComponent**: Displays the navigation bar.
- **CourseListComponent**: Shows a list of courses available for enrollment.
- **AnnouncementComponent**: Displays recent announcements.

## Services
- **AuthService**: Handles user authentication and session management.
- **CourseService**: Fetches course data from the backend.

## Challenges

During the development of the university website, several challenges were encountered:
- **User Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication was complex, requiring integration with third-party services for added security.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website is mobile-friendly and accessible on various devices posed design challenges.
- **Data Management**: Handling large datasets for courses and announcements required efficient state management and API integration.

## Backend Technology

The backend of the university website is built using:
- **.NET**: A robust framework for building scalable web applications.
- **ASP.NET Core**: Used to create RESTful APIs for handling requests.
- **SQL Server**: A relational database used to store user data, course information, and announcements.

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/login**: Authenticates users and returns a token.
- **GET /api/courses**: Retrieves a list of available courses.
- **GET /api/announcements**: Fetches the latest announcements from the university.

This backend setup ensures a robust and scalable application that can handle user requests efficiently.
